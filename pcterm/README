PCTerm for psplink v0.1 (c) TyRaNiD 2k6

This is a very simple application for use when connecting to the wifi
shell of psplink. You need readline5 to build it, all it does is provide
a readline shell for communicating with the wifi shell to add back the
bits which are missing on the native psp side like command line history.
Of course it is even better than that, it provides full cli editing
into the bargin so it better even that the inbuilt sio shell.

Just type make then run the shell with ./pcterm pspipaddress
