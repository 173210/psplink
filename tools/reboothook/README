Reboot hook for PSPLINK (c) TyRaNiD 2k6

This is a simple tool to patch out the plain text module check during a reset
of the kernel. It allows you to run pretty much anything from LoadExec such
as prx files which usually cause the system to drop back to the vsh. 

USAGE: 

Run make to build the executable and then in PSPLINK run setup.sh. Ensure 
that the current shell directory is the same as the one containing 
reboothook.bin. Once you run the script you can loadexec anything from ms0
(host will not be up anyway at that point so it wont work). 

For example typing into the shell :

./setup.sh
me @vsh ms0:/psp/game/psplink/psplink.prx

will reboot the main part of psplink in vsh mode. Note if you do this you
can only reset if you either rerun the setup.sh or do
me ms0:/psp/game/psplink/eboot.pbp
