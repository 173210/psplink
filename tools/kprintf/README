PSPLINK USB Kprintf driver (c) TyRaNiD 2k6

This is a simple tool to output kprintf via USB (or for that matter wifi) which by default isn't possible.
Kprintf is designed to be called from virtually anywhere, with interrupts enabled or disabled so in the
usual case you cannot just pass the characters to printf and expect them to work as they probably wont,
if you are lucky you get away with it but most of the time it will probably crash the PSP. This app works
by throwing the characters into a buffer and signalling a thread to print the data set. There is a small
risk of an infinite loop occuring if the event flag screws up but hopefully that wont happen very often :P

To use ensure kprintf=1 in the psplink.ini file and then run usbkprintf.prx. Kprintf should now go via
the normal printf channel.

There are a couple of bugs/limitations with this app, if the 4k buffer fills up kprintf data will be lost,
you can see this if you run memblocks in the shell for example. And there is the aformentioned risk of
an infinite loop, most certainly do not run with a debug build of usbhostfs unless you like holding the
power button. Still it should be good enough to capture the errors from module loads etc which are sometimes
very useful :)
