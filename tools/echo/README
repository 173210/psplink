This is a simple example of the Asynchronous Provider Framework (APF) for PSPLINK.
It creates an echo server so you can connect on to your localhost and it will 
echo back the results to you. To prove it isn't cheating the text will also be
displayed on the PSP's screen.

To use run echo.prx and it will print the port to connect to, now use something 
like netcat to connect to localhost on the port specified and start typing.
