-= What is this? =-

PSPLINK is an attempt at producing a loader/development application to eliminate 
the need to go back to the VSH everytime. It provides a shell over the SIO connection
from which you can load new apps, dump useful system information and then reset the
PSP to start another application. The program mounts the USB device so you can copy
new executables onto the ms for execution. It also eliminates some of the boilerplate
code necessary for executables, it installs stdio and kprintf handlers for tty output
as well as providing a built in exception handler. Almost all applications can now
be run in user mode only without having to resort to ugly kernel mode hacks.

-= Installation =-

From source type 'make release' to build a release directory. Now copy the 
files appropriate for your firmware revision.

-= Usage =-

Setup a serial terminal at 115200 baud 8N1. Run psplink from the VSH and in a few 
seconds a shell prompt should be printed. When this happens you can now type commands.

To get a list of available commands type 'help'. To get a slightly more detailed 
description of a command type 'help command'.

To get started quickly in order to run a new pspsdk compiled application copy the ELF 
to the memory stick (say in the root directory) and type 'exec ms0:/program.elf' replacing
program.elf with the name of the app. The application should now run, the shell 
however should still be accessible to type new commands such as listing the current
threads (the 'thlist' command). When you are done with the current app then either 
type 'reset' to reset the system or just run another application. If you want to 
rerun the current application then type 'exec' with no filename, this will automatically
reboot the psp and rerun your the last application.
