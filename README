PSPLINK is licensed under the BSD license, see LICENSE in PSPLINK root for details.

NOTE: This is still a work in progress. Treat it as such :P This will NOT work
on anything but V1.0 and V1.5 PSPs because it requires kernel mode. Nothing which
can be done about that at present I am afraid.

Please read the manual document for installation instructions and an example
of usage.
