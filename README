-= What is this? =-

PSPLINK is an attempt at producing a loader/development application to eliminate 
the need to go back to the VSH everytime. It provides a shell over the SIO or WIFI 
connection from which you can load new apps, dump useful system information and then 
reset the PSP to start another application. The program mounts the USB device so you 
can copy new executables onto the ms for execution. It also eliminates some of the 
boilerplate code necessary for executables, it installs stdio and kprintf handlers for 
tty output as well as providing a built in exception handler. Almost all applications 
can now be run in user mode only without having to resort to ugly kernel mode hacks.

-= Installation =-

From source type 'make release' to build a release directory. Now copy the 
files appropriate for your firmware revision.

-= Usage =-

Setup a serial terminal at 115200 baud 8N1. Run psplink from the VSH and in a few 
seconds a shell prompt should be printed. When this happens you can now type commands.

If you want a wifi shell then configure the first wifi setup in the VSH and then edit
the psplink.ini file to set wifishell=1. When psplink start the wifi connection info
should be printed on the screen with the IP address that the PSP is listening on. Now
use telnet or netcat to connect to this ip address on port 23 and the shell should 
appear.

To get a list of available commands type 'help'. To get a slightly more detailed 
description of a command type 'help command'.

To get started quickly in order to run a new pspsdk compiled application copy the ELF 
to the memory stick (say in the root directory) and type 'exec ms0:/program.elf' replacing
program.elf with the name of the app. The application should now run, the shell 
however should still be accessible to type new commands such as listing the current
threads (the 'thlist' command). When you are done with the current app then either 
type 'reset' to reset the system or just run another application. If you want to 
rerun the current application then type 'exec' with no filename, this will automatically
reboot the psp and rerun your the last application.
